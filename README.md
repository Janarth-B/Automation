# Automation
The Automation of the Thermal Calibrator

# Abstract
 This project report highlights the automation of the thermal calibrator of Graphtec GL7000 and Isotech 820 & Millik devices. The project aimed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the calibration process through the development of a Python-based automation solution. The solution involved data acquisition, concatenation, and analysis, facilitated by a user-friendly interface created with the Tkinter library. The project's methodology consisted of establishing communication with the Graphtec and Isotech Milik devices using the PySerial library.
Data extraction scripts were developed to fetch relevant information from the devices, which was then stored in Excel files for further analysis.
The Python Tkinter library was utilized to create an intuitive interface that allowed users to input parameters and initiate data acquisition seamlessly.
The results and analysis of the project demonstrated successful automation of the data acquisition process.
The automation solution significantly reduced the time required for acquiring data from the thermal calibrator devices, enhancing overall efficiency. Moreover, the accuracy of data fetching and concatenation improved, minimizing the likelihood of human errors.
The developed user interface played a crucial role in streamlining the calibration process. Users reported increased efficiency and productivity, as the interface simplified the data concatenation and analysis tasks. The automation solution proved effective in improving the overall quality of the calibration process at Ashok Leyland Technical Centre.
The project include expanding the functionality of the user interface to incorporate advanced features such as data visualization and reporting. Real-time data streaming for live monitoring and analysis can be explored to further enhance the automation solution. Integration with additional calibration devices may provide a comprehensive solution for calibration processes in diverse scenarios.
Thus, the automation of the thermal calibrator using Graphtec and Isotech Milik devices successfully improved the efficiency and accuracy of the calibration process.
The Python-based automation solution, coupled with the user-friendly interface, streamlined data acquisition, concatenation, and analysis.
